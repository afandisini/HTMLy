# Themes HTMLy AMP-HTML PROJECT
This Project themes AMP-HTML for CMS HTMLy
I applied this theme to HTMLy using the template template from <strong>amp.dev</strong> with the title <strong>"BAKE SHOP" and "AMP-PROJECT"</strong>.<br>why so my choice because the template is very good value when tested with several SEO engines.<br>After I applied the Project themes on my website, the results were very satisfying, I tested it on the <strong>web.dev</strong> the numbers appeared so good, although there were still some shortcomings that still had to be fixed. Please help to develop.<br>
You can apply the theme to HTMLy CMS.<br>after you download it, put it in the theme folder directory, then enter the admin login.<br>
For example <i>\\localhost\{host:local}\login</i> in the settings menu, apply the theme column <strong>"BAKE SHOP" or "amp-project"</strong>
